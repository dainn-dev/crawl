# Coverage Analysis Guide

## How to Know if `crawl_progress.json` Contains All URLs from a Site

This guide explains how to determine if your `crawl_progress.json` file contains all URLs from a site by comparing it with the database records.

## Quick Answer

Use the **Crawl Coverage Analyzer** to check:

```bash
python crawl_coverage_analyzer.py analyze <domain>
```

This will tell you:
- ‚úÖ **Coverage percentage** (how many DB URLs are in progress)
- ‚úÖ **Missing URLs** (DB URLs not in progress)
- ‚úÖ **Extra URLs** (progress URLs not in DB)
- ‚úÖ **Quality assessment** (Excellent/Good/Moderate/Poor)

## Coverage Analysis Commands

### 1. **Full Coverage Analysis**
```bash
python crawl_coverage_analyzer.py analyze cylaw.org
```

**Shows:**
- Coverage summary and percentages
- Missing/extra URL analysis
- Coverage status and recommendations
- Depth analysis
- Status code breakdown

### 2. **Detailed Statistics**
```bash
python crawl_coverage_analyzer.py stats cylaw.org
```

**Shows:**
- Coverage metrics and percentages
- Quality assessment
- Specific recommendations
- Efficiency analysis

### 3. **Find Missing URLs**
```bash
python crawl_coverage_analyzer.py missing cylaw.org
```

**Shows:**
- URLs in database but missing from progress
- Grouped by URL patterns
- Sample missing URLs

### 4. **Compare Progress vs Database**
```bash
python crawl_coverage_analyzer.py compare cylaw.org
```

**Shows:**
- URL pattern analysis
- Depth distribution comparison
- Pattern differences

## Coverage Quality Levels

### **‚úÖ EXCELLENT COVERAGE (‚â•99.5%)**
```
Coverage: 100.00% (DB URLs in progress)
Efficiency: 100.00% (Progress URLs in DB)
Status: ‚úÖ EXCELLENT COVERAGE
```
**Meaning:** Progress file contains virtually all database URLs

### **‚ö†Ô∏è GOOD COVERAGE (95-99.4%)**
```
Coverage: 97.5% (DB URLs in progress)
Status: ‚ö†Ô∏è GOOD COVERAGE
```
**Meaning:** Most URLs are covered, but some may be missing

### **‚ö†Ô∏è MODERATE COVERAGE (80-94.9%)**
```
Coverage: 85.2% (DB URLs in progress)
Status: ‚ö†Ô∏è MODERATE COVERAGE
```
**Meaning:** Significant number of URLs missing from progress

### **‚ùå POOR COVERAGE (<80%)**
```
Coverage: 65.8% (DB URLs in progress)
Status: ‚ùå POOR COVERAGE
```
**Meaning:** Many URLs missing from progress file

```

**Interpretation:** ‚úÖ Perfect coverage - all database URLs are in progress

### **Missing URLs Example:**
```
üìä COVERAGE SUMMARY:
   Database URLs: 10,000
   Progress URLs: 8,500
   Overlapping URLs: 8,500
   Coverage: 85.0%

üìà MISSING ANALYSIS:
   URLs in DB but not in progress: 1,500
   URLs in progress but not in DB: 0

üéØ COVERAGE STATUS: ‚ö†Ô∏è MODERATE COVERAGE
üí° RECOMMENDATION: Significant number of URLs missing from progress
```

**Interpretation:** ‚ö†Ô∏è 1,500 URLs missing from progress file

## How to Fix Coverage Issues

### **If URLs are Missing from Progress:**

1. **Sync database to progress:**
   ```bash
   python db_sync_util.py sync cylaw.org
   ```

2. **Verify the sync:**
   ```bash
   python crawl_coverage_analyzer.py analyze cylaw.org
   ```

3. **Check missing URLs:**
   ```bash
   python crawl_coverage_analyzer.py missing cylaw.org
   ```

### **If Progress has Extra URLs:**

1. **Review extra URLs:**
   ```bash
   python crawl_coverage_analyzer.py compare cylaw.org
   ```

2. **Clean up if needed:**
   ```bash
   python db_sync_util.py clear_progress
   python db_sync_util.py sync cylaw.org
   ```

## Understanding the Metrics

### **Coverage Percentage**
- **Formula:** `(Overlapping URLs / Database URLs) √ó 100`
- **Meaning:** How many database URLs are in progress file
- **Goal:** ‚â•99.5% for excellent coverage

### **Efficiency Percentage**
- **Formula:** `(Overlapping URLs / Progress URLs) √ó 100`
- **Meaning:** How many progress URLs are in database
- **Goal:** ‚â•99.5% for excellent efficiency

### **Missing Rate**
- **Formula:** `(Missing URLs / Database URLs) √ó 100`
- **Meaning:** Percentage of DB URLs not in progress
- **Goal:** ‚â§0.5% for excellent coverage

### **Extra Rate**
- **Formula:** `(Extra URLs / Progress URLs) √ó 100`
- **Meaning:** Percentage of progress URLs not in DB
- **Goal:** ‚â§0.5% for excellent efficiency

## Step-by-Step Coverage Check

### **Step 1: Quick Check**
```bash
python crawl_coverage_analyzer.py analyze cylaw.org
```

### **Step 2: If Issues Found**
```bash
# Check detailed statistics
python crawl_coverage_analyzer.py stats cylaw.org

# Find specific missing URLs
python crawl_coverage_analyzer.py missing cylaw.org

# Compare patterns
python crawl_coverage_analyzer.py compare cylaw.org
```

### **Step 3: Fix Issues**
```bash
# Sync missing URLs
python db_sync_util.py sync cylaw.org

# Verify fix
python crawl_coverage_analyzer.py analyze cylaw.org
```

## Common Scenarios

### **Scenario 1: Empty Progress File**
```bash
# Check what's in database
python db_sync_util.py check cylaw.org

# Sync database to progress
python db_sync_util.py sync cylaw.org

# Verify coverage
python crawl_coverage_analyzer.py analyze cylaw.org
```

### **Scenario 2: Partial Progress**
```bash
# Check current coverage
python crawl_coverage_analyzer.py analyze cylaw.org

# If coverage < 95%, sync missing URLs
python db_sync_util.py sync cylaw.org

# Verify improved coverage
python crawl_coverage_analyzer.py analyze cylaw.org
```

### **Scenario 3: Progress Out of Sync**
```bash
# Check for extra URLs
python crawl_coverage_analyzer.py compare cylaw.org

# If many extra URLs, clean and resync
python db_sync_util.py clear_progress
python db_sync_util.py sync cylaw.org

# Verify clean coverage
python crawl_coverage_analyzer.py analyze cylaw.org
```

## Integration with Other Tools

### **Database Cleanup + Coverage Check**
```bash
# Clean database first
python db_cleanup.py cleanup

# Then check coverage
python crawl_coverage_analyzer.py analyze cylaw.org
```

### **Speed Monitoring + Coverage Check**
```bash
# Check coverage before crawling
python crawl_coverage_analyzer.py analyze cylaw.org

# If good coverage, start crawling
python run_fast_crawler.py

# Monitor speed
python speed_monitor_util.py watch
```

## Best Practices

### **Before Starting a New Crawl:**
1. Check current coverage: `python crawl_coverage_analyzer.py analyze <domain>`
2. If coverage < 95%, sync missing URLs: `python db_sync_util.py sync <domain>`
3. Verify coverage is excellent: `python crawl_coverage_analyzer.py analyze <domain>`
4. Start crawling: `python run_fast_crawler.py`

### **After Completing a Crawl:**
1. Check final coverage: `python crawl_coverage_analyzer.py analyze <domain>`
2. If coverage is excellent, you're done
3. If coverage < 99.5%, investigate missing URLs

### **Regular Maintenance:**
1. Weekly coverage check: `python crawl_coverage_analyzer.py analyze <domain>`
2. Monthly database cleanup: `python db_cleanup.py cleanup`
3. Quarterly full sync: `python db_sync_util.py sync <domain>`

This comprehensive coverage analysis ensures you always know if your `crawl_progress.json` contains all URLs from a site and helps you maintain optimal crawling efficiency!
